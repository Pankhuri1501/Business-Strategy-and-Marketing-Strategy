Scenario:Threat of New Entrants: Moderate due to rapid innovation but low capital requirements for startups.
Supplier Power: High with dependence on component suppliers like chip manufacturers.
Buyer Power: High as customers compare features and prices extensively.
Substitute Threat: Continuous innovation with alternatives like cloud computing replacing traditional servers
Rivalry: Intense, with players like Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft.

CASE STUDY: AMAZON’S STRATEGY
Overview: Amazon’s strategic dominance is a result of effectively navigating Porter’s Five Forces.
Detailed Analysis:
Threat of New Entrants:
• Highbarriers due to economies of scale, established logistics network, and strong brand loyalty.
• Continuous innovation, such as AWS (Amazon Web Services), further deters new competitors.
 Supplier Power: 
• Amazon reduces supplier power by vertically integrating its supply chain and negotiating bulk contracts.

CASE STUDY: AMAZON’S STRATEGY
Buyer Power:
• Amazon empowers buyers with competitive pricing, extensive product variety, and convenience (e.g., Prime services).
• However, customer loyalty programs reduce buyer power by creating high switching costs.
Substitute Threat:
• Diversification into multiple sectors, including streaming, cloud computing, and smart devices, minimizes reliance on any one market.
• Continuous innovation in customer experience, such as one-day delivery, mitigates substitution risk.
Competitive Rivalry:
• Amazon’s scale, technological advancements, and low-cost operations allow it to outpace competitors.
• Aggressive pricing and partnerships further solidify its market position
